# 🛍️ ShopShap

Welcome to **ShopShap**, a modern, responsive fashion storefront built as a **mini-project** to practice **UI/UX design** using the **Svelte** framework and **Tailwind CSS**.

This project represents my exploration of a new and exciting frontend stack, focusing on clean design, component structure, and modern styling practices. It's a personal practice project—but built with a developer’s care and a designer’s eye.

## ✨ Why This Project?

As someone passionate about both design and development, I wanted to challenge myself by learning **Svelte**, a fast and elegant JavaScript framework. Pairing it with **Tailwind CSS** allowed me to rapidly prototype beautiful, responsive layouts while keeping code maintainable and scalable.

> 🧠 My goal: Build something that *looks great*, *works cleanly*, and shows off how fun and powerful modern frontend tools can be.
